My job is to help you communicate your brand, message, and values in a short, concise video or series of videos. I believe a blend of information and personal narrative always helps people connect to your business and brand, and a sprinkle of humor doesn’t hurt, either! Please take a look at the videos below, and I can’t wait to hear from you!'

This most recent series I have been a part of producing is in collaboration with Paul Shirley, ex NBA basketball player turned author, who has created a process by which to work independently and achieve one's career goals with added ease, confidence, and support from community. His company - conveniently named “The Process” - focuses on building habits and routines rather than achieving specific goals, something that is in line with his motto and the title of his latest book: “The Process is The Product”

This series was for CFI Institute, a commercial greenhouse in Arvada, CO, where I created a series of instructional videos for their employees to expedite the training process. The greenhouse was known for growing organic tomatoes as well as hiring people with a criminal record who would otherwise be hard-pressed to find work in today's culture. 

And there is more:


I worked with a teacher of Non-Violent Communication filming her students at a local elementary school, and created a 9 video series of interviews with adult volunteers who worked closely with the students teaching this method of emotional awareness. The videos were used for fundraising purposes, but for privacy reasons I cannot share the videos on a public platform.
