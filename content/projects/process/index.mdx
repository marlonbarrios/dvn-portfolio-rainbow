This most recent series I have been a part of producing is in collaboration with Paul Shirley, ex NBA basketball player turned author, who has created a process by which to work independently and achieve one's career goals with added ease, confidence, and support from community. His company - conveniently named “The Process” - focuses on building habits and routines rather than achieving specific goals, something that is in line with his motto and the title of his latest book: “The Process is The Product”
