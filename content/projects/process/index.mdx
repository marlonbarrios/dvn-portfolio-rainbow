Pecus Magna was a short film shot and edited in 24 hours for the Pueblo 24 Hr Film Festival. Easily the most fun I have had on a film project, it went on to win Most Creative Film in the festival. 

This short tells the story of Michael, a young man suffering from strange dreams. His therapist encourages him to talk about it, only Michaels soon discovers a connection between his therapist and a strange, bloody creature in his dreams.
