This series was for CFI Institute, a commercial greenhouse in Arvada, CO, where I created a series of instructional videos for their employees to expedite the training process. The greenhouse was known for growing organic tomatoes as well as hiring people with a criminal record who would otherwise be hard-pressed to find work in today's culture.
